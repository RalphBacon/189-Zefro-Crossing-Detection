### #189 Zero Crossing Detection
Detect when an AC signal crosses zero (part of TRIAC control project)

A safe experiment in mains zero crossing with an Arduino using interrupts.
JLCPCB Only $2 for PCB Prototype any colour https://jlcpcb.com/

As part of my quest to replace the potentially dangerous electronics in a recently acquired fan speed controller, the first step is for the Arduino to know exactly when the mains AC waveform is at the zero point in its cycle. 

Here we can see how easy it is to configure the Arduino with just a few lines of code to detect this using a simple interrupt routine.

We also have a 2 minute look at the progress on my Smart Phone Charger, as the PCB from JCLPCB has arrived and is looking good!
